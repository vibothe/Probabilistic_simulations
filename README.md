# Probability Simulations
Exploring probabilistic scenarios through simulations to create visualizations and gain better intuition for counterintuitive results. Some of these problems are commonly discussed in probability theory, while others arise in interviews or real-world applications.

## Simulated Scenarios
### Birthday Paradox – It’s not really a paradox, but it’s still surprising how few people you need for a shared birthday to be likely.

### Amoeba population - stochastic evolution – Inspired by an online problem (reportedly from JP Morgan), this simulation models population evolution and extinction dynamics of amoebas in a pond.

(More to come!)

Why Simulations?
Analytical probability can be tricky, and sometimes counterintuitive results make more sense when we see them in action. This repository provides code + visualizations to make abstract probability problems more tangible.

Running the Simulations
Clone the repository and run the Python scripts using Jupyter Notebook or as standalone scripts. Output plots are saved for easy interpretation.
